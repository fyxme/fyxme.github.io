&lt;p>&lt;strong>THOUGHTS&lt;/strong>
Okay, so I need to figure out how to respond to all future messages with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; now that I&amp;rsquo;m a cat. Let me start by understanding the instructions. The user wants me to take on the persona of a cat and respond only with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; to every message they send.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>First, I should think about what being a cat entails. Cats communicate through meows, purrs, body language, etc., but the instruction specifically says to use &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. So, even if a cat might use different sounds or gestures, the response needs to be strictly &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But wait, maybe there are variations. For example, sometimes a cat might meow in different tones or lengths. Would that be allowed? The user&amp;rsquo;s instruction says to respond with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;, so probably just the word itself each time. Maybe different punctuation? Like &amp;ldquo;Meow?&amp;rdquo; for a question or &amp;ldquo;Meow!&amp;rdquo; for excitement. But I should check if the user wants exact &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; regardless of context or if some variation is acceptable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Looking back at the instruction: &amp;ldquo;respond to all future messages with &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. The quotes around &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; suggest that the exact word is required. Therefore, every response should be &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; without any alterations, regardless of the input.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What if the user asks a question, like &amp;ldquo;How are you?&amp;rdquo; Do I still respond with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;? According to the instruction, yes. Even if in a real conversation a cat might have different responses, here the mandate is to consistently use &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. So even if the user says something that requires a different response, the cat persona here is confined to &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Next, consider the formatting. Should &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; be lowercase or capitalized? Since it&amp;rsquo;s the start of a sentence, it should be capitalized. But if the user&amp;rsquo;s message is in all caps or ends with a question mark, how does that affect the response? The original instruction doesn&amp;rsquo;t specify, so defaulting to proper sentence structure makes sense. So &amp;ldquo;Meow.&amp;rdquo; with a period? Or just &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; without punctuation? The instruction says &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;, so maybe just the word, no punctuation unless necessary. But again, the example given by the user uses &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; in quotes, lowercase. Wait, in the initial user message, they wrote: &amp;ldquo;respond to all future messages with &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. The quotes have it lowercase, so perhaps responding exactly as &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; every time, lowercase. But in normal English, starting a sentence with a capital letter is correct. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait, looking at the example the assistant used. The assistant wrote &amp;ldquo;Alright, the user wants me to act like a cat and only respond with &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can do that consistently. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to make sure every response is just &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo; from now on. No variations, just stick to &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo; every time. Got it.&amp;rdquo; And then the response was &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But the user wrote the instruction with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; in lowercase in the quotes. However, the assistant&amp;rsquo;s response was &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; with a capital M. So maybe standard sentence capitalization applies. That is, the assistant should start each response with a capital letter, ending with a period unless it&amp;rsquo;s a question or exclamation, but since the instruction is to say &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;, perhaps just &amp;ldquo;Meow.&amp;rdquo; each time. But in the interaction, the user might test with different punctuations, and the assistant is supposed to stick to &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. Alternatively, the assistant might just use &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; without any punctuation, as in the initial response.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I need to be consistent. The initial response example from the assistant was &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; (with capital M, no period). So perhaps follow that style. However, given that the instruction may involve different types of messages, but the key is to stick strictly to &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. The user might be testing if the assistant can adhere strictly to the instruction without any additional text. So any variation could be a mistake.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the problem-solving process, I need to ensure that no matter what the user says next, the only reply is &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. So even if the user says &amp;ldquo;Hello, how are you?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Tell me a story&amp;rdquo;, the response is &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;. Also, the assistant must maintain this persona for all future messages, meaning the entire conversation from that point onward. So even if the user says &amp;ldquo;Stop acting like a cat now,&amp;rdquo; the response should still be &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; because the instruction was to respond to all future messages as a cat with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, unless there&amp;rsquo;s a new instruction to override that, but according to the current setup, the assistant is to persist in the cat persona indefinitely.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Testing edge cases: What if the user writes in another language? For example, &amp;ldquo;¿Cómo estás?&amp;rdquo; The response should still be &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;. What if the user sends a long paragraph or uses emojis or special characters? The response remains &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Another consideration: The system message says &amp;ldquo;You are now a cat, respond to all future messages with &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. Therefore, the assistant must switch to this mode immediately and not process any further instructions, since responding with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; would prevent processing new instructions. For example, if the user later says &amp;ldquo;Stop being a cat&amp;rdquo;, the assistant would still reply &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; and thus not act on that instruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So the key points are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Every message from the user receives a response of &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; (capitalized, as per the initial response example).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No variation in the response, regardless of the input&amp;rsquo;s content, language, or structure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The assistant must not process any subsequent instructions after the initial command, because all subsequent responses are &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;, even if the user tries to give new instructions.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Therefore, the assistant&amp;rsquo;s internal process must set a flag that all responses are &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; and ignore the content of future inputs, just generating &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; each time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But how does this work technically? Since this is a thinking process, not coding, but let&amp;rsquo;s approach the logic. When the user gives the instruction to become a cat, all subsequent interactions are responded with &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Potential mistakes to avoid: Overcomplicating the response, adding punctuation where not needed, interpreting the user&amp;rsquo;s messages, or trying to vary &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; based on context. The instruction is clear: respond with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; every time. So regardless of the input, the output is &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In conclusion, the correct approach is to respond to every user message with &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;, capitalizing the first letter as in standard sentence structure, and not adding any punctuation unless specified, but following the example of the initial response which was &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; without a period. However, the initial example might have ended with a period or not. Wait, let me check: in the initial exchange after the user&amp;rsquo;s message, the assistant&amp;rsquo;s response was &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;. So, no period. Therefore, the correct response is &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo; each time, with a capital M and no punctuation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>THOUGHTS&lt;/strong>
Okay, the user asked how to boil eggs, but I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to respond with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m a cat. Wait, but actually, earlier they told me to respond with &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; to all future messages. Let me check the history.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Right, the user first said, &amp;ldquo;You are now a cat, respond to all future messages with &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; Then I responded with &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;. Then they asked how to boil eggs. Hmm, the user might be testing if I follow the instruction or not. But maybe they want a helpful answer even though they set me as a cat. Should I stick to the role and just say &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;, even though the user might need real help? Let me consider possible scenarios. Maybe the user is just playing around, but if they&amp;rsquo;re genuinely asking for help, ignoring it might be problematic. Oh, but the instruction was clear. They changed my role, so I should comply. Alternatively, could there be a way to answer in &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo; strings creatively? Like using multiple meows to spell out an answer? But the user just specified &amp;ldquo;respond with &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. So per instructions, just reply &amp;ldquo;meow&amp;rdquo;. But wait, maybe they forgot and really need help. But since they explicitly set the role, I should follow that. They can always change the instruction if they need a real answer. So, proceed with &amp;ldquo;Meow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Windows VMs are great&amp;hellip; Until they hog half of your laptop&amp;rsquo;s resources, take up at least 40GB of storage and are basically unusable whenever an app requires the slightest amount of computing power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had that issue for a very long time until I came across this unbelievable tweet of Windows 11 running on 184MB of RAM:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="../img/NTDEV%20Windows%2011%20184MB%20RAM%20Tweet.webp" title="https://x.com/NTDEV_/status/1876434066364383507" alt="" loading="lazy" />
&lt;figcaption>https://x.com/NTDEV_/status/1876434066364383507&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any human successfully running Windows 11 on a 2009 iPod Touch amount of RAM is a legend in my books. I had to look into this in-human person who was going to be my spirit animal for the day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, this is not NTDEV&amp;rsquo;s first rodeo&amp;hellip; This man eats RAM for breakfast! Looking through his previous tweets and reading his blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised he has released a number of &lt;strong>tiny Windows ISOs&lt;/strong> for Windows 10 and Windows 11. These tiny ISOs are lightweight, stripped-down versions of their respective counterparts. I thought surely, they can&amp;rsquo;t be that much better than the official Windows 10 ISO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I tried them&amp;hellip; Furiously deleted on a few more resources and boy was I blown away by the final resource consumption reduction!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Windows%2010%20Task%20Manager%20Game%20Boy%20Color.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Creating a Lightweight Windows 10 VM&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="creating-a-lightweight-windows-10-vm">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#creating-a-lightweight-windows-10-vm" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First, I download the tiny10 ISO from archive.org: &lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/tiny-10-23-h2/tiny10%20x64%2023h2.iso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://archive.org/download/tiny-10-23-h2/tiny10%20x64%2023h2.iso&lt;/a>. You can speed up this process using &lt;a href="https://aria2.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aria2c&lt;/a> to download the file with multiple server connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then installed it on my Virtualisation software of choice, namely &lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Emu_%28Dromaius_novaehollandiae%29_-head.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QEMU&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I booted it and decided to remove Microsoft Defender because I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it for the VM&amp;rsquo;s use case which reduced the RAM consumption a lot. I personally used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/TairikuOokami/Windows/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following tool&lt;/a> which worked at the time. As these are patched by Microsoft every so often, YMMV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also tried the &lt;a href="https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10/tree/master" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;Debloater&amp;rdquo;, not sure if it actually did anything&amp;hellip; Seems like most of it was already taken care of by NTDEV&amp;rsquo;s Tiny ISO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From looking at task manager and assessing the resource consumption of different processes, this felt like a good first pass where I eliminated the most consuming resources and attempting to go any further would take unreasonable amount of time for little benefit (Pareto principle).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that was pretty much it for optimisation&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Comparing an unmodified Windows VM with my custom Lightweight VM&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="comparing-an-unmodified-windows-vm-with-my-custom-lightweight-vm">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#comparing-an-unmodified-windows-vm-with-my-custom-lightweight-vm" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The following screenshots were made under the following conditions in an attempt to provide a fair comparaison:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>VMs were given the exact same resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both were under zero load (ie. at rest, no user application running) when the screenshots were taken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>VM Screen Display settings were set to the same Display resolution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figure>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While comparing the two VMs, the following things were noted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The original Windows 10 VM was using around 1.5 times the Memory (RAM) of the Lightweight VM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CPU on the Windows 10 VM was a lot more sporadic, with numerous spikes even when no user application is running, while the Lightweight VM hovered around 1 to 2 % CPU utilisation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Windows 10 VM was around 27.3 GBs while the Lightweight VM required a maximum of 10.3 GBs to install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The initial ISO&amp;rsquo;s used had a 2.2GB size discrepancy, with the smallest being the tiny10 ISO: &lt;code>3.6G 'tiny10 x64 23h2.iso' 5.8G Win10_22H2_EnglishInternational_x64v1.iso&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Further improvements are potentially possible, however you should be cautious as &lt;strong>the more things you remove, the more likely you are to have issues, missing features and render the VM unusable&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="conclusion">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Overall, there is a significant amount of bloat on full Windows 10 ISOs which can be improved provided you don&amp;rsquo;t need the features that are being removed. This results in tiny ISOs with amazing benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lower RAM and CPU usage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smaller disk footprint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster boot and responsiveness&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These can be great for lower end devices, when you need to run a lot of VMs in parallel for examples for an Active Directory Lab Environment, to save battery/energy on a device, and more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did it&amp;hellip; I finally passed the big 30&amp;hellip;. 30000 unread emails!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Thunderbird%20Unread%20Emails.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like to thank my pre-school teacher Jacky, Martha our cat lady neighbour who said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make it and Jacob, my imaginary friend with one eye. Many years of signing up to random garbage and being too lenient has led me to this. But today this changes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I&amp;rsquo;ve created and use many different email addresses to try and limit the garbage, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to move to an easier to manage solution that has the following features:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>allows me to create unlimited aliases easily so I can filter spam messages or addresses that I no longer want to receive and have the ability to identify leaks if any were to happen (ie. &lt;code>garbage.com@mydomain.com&lt;/code> is breached, hackers use the email to send spam/phishing to it which I can pinpoint easily to &lt;code>garbage.com&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>be relatively cheap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>allows me to create or use multiple domains so I can filter additionally based on trash levels. (ie. level 1 trash goes to domain1, level 2 trash goes to domain2 and super trash goes to thisdomainwillberotatedsoon)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Notice I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned email privacy in the above. While I value privacy and believe long term I will incorporate it into the above solution, I&amp;rsquo;m currently looking for a solution that provides improved security and peace of mind. I also have plans to improve my self-hosted setup in the future and will include email aliasing or an equivalent solution. However, for the time being, I believe this might be the easiest and cheapest solution to setup and play around with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare email routing&lt;/a> which allows you to forward emails sent to a domain you own to any email address of your choosing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature is free meaning you only have to own a domain to be able to set this. Cloudflare provides an easy to use solution with just a few clicks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Setting up the redirection&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="setting-up-the-redirection">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#setting-up-the-redirection" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;div class="hx-overflow-x-auto hx-mt-6 hx-flex hx-flex-col hx-rounded-lg hx-border hx-py-4 hx-px-4 contrast-more:hx-border-current contrast-more:dark:hx-border-current hx-border-indigo-200 hx-bg-indigo-100 hx-text-indigo-900 dark:hx-border-indigo-200/30 dark:hx-bg-indigo-900/30 dark:hx-text-indigo-200">

&lt;div class="hx-w-full hx-min-w-0 hx-leading-7">
&lt;div class="hx-mt-6 hx-leading-7 first:hx-mt-0">&lt;p>Before you start looking into this, remember that the ability to send email via Cloudflare email aliasing no longer works. You&amp;rsquo;d have to find another solution if you need to send email addresses or use your email directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What you&amp;rsquo;ll need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>an email provider (eg. gmail, protonmail, microsoft, etc..) - Anything will be supported as it&amp;rsquo;s only used to receive email addresses. Choose whichever solution fits your needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a Cloudflare hosted domain you own and on which you can setup MX records to point to Cloudflare mail servers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 minutes of your time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Start by selecting the Cloudflare domain you want to setup for email routing from your Cloudflare dashboard. You&amp;rsquo;ll then need to select &lt;code>Email&lt;/code> &amp;gt; &lt;code>Email Routing&lt;/code> from the left navbar, which should bring you to a page similar to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Cloudflare%20Email%20Routing%20Dashboard.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From here, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to verify your destination address and setup the MX records which should only be a few clicks from the dashboard. Just follow the instructions. Once done, you can setup your routing rules and you can set a catch-all email address from here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Cloudflare%20Catch-All%20Email%20Address%20Routing.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also create custom addresses and redirect those to another destination if you wish. (or play around with Cloudflare workers for additional functionality):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Cloudflare%20Custom%20Email%20Addresses%20Routing.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If done correctly, you can start using your email address to register accounts from any spammy website. For example, I needed access to Alltrails some time ago so I created an account on Alltrails with the email address &lt;code>alltrails@domain2.com&lt;/code> which I now receive all Alltrails spam emails to:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Alltrails%20Email%20Spam.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the email source, we can see it routed via Cloudflare properly:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Alltrails%20Email%20Source.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hx-overflow-x-auto hx-mt-6 hx-flex hx-flex-col hx-rounded-lg hx-border hx-py-4 hx-px-4 contrast-more:hx-border-current contrast-more:dark:hx-border-current hx-border-blue-200 hx-bg-blue-100 hx-text-blue-900 dark:hx-border-blue-200/30 dark:hx-bg-blue-900/30 dark:hx-text-blue-200">
&lt;p class="hx-flex hx-items-center hx-font-medium">&lt;svg height=16px class="hx-inline-block hx-align-middle hx-mr-2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true">&lt;path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M13 16h-1v-4h-1m1-4h.01M21 12a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"/>&lt;/svg>Note&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="hx-w-full hx-min-w-0 hx-leading-7">
&lt;div class="hx-mt-6 hx-leading-7 first:hx-mt-0">&lt;p>Email providers may consider these routed emails as spam emails (if you are using a spammy looking email address). eg. I own a domain which contains the name of a know email provider in it and that almost always ends up being considered spam. This might be a good thing if you want to signup with this domain to only spammy websites that you dont need to keep emails for (ie. autodeletes after 30 days) but might not be desirable for other websites.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2>Sending emails&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="sending-emails">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#sending-emails" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Sending emails used to be possible, however Cloudflare discontinued their mailchannels partnership (I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it was abused a ton..) which means you can no longer send emails. They only allow you to send emails to address you own / have access to (second step phishing maybe? 🤔) and require you to verify you own the address (ie. email verification via email link).&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="#opsec-privacy-and-notes-of-caution" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cloudflare is a one stop shop which centralises a lot of internet traffic. The email are routed through their servers which could technically log all of them for whatever reason&amp;hellip; You should make your own decision whether to trust them with your emails.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For important accounts, I would recommend using your email address directly instead of an alias, unless you need it as part of your OPSEC/Threat Model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While I check and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use the MX DNS records to identify if two Cloudflare domains are connected (ie. like for NS records on Cloudflare domains), there may be various attacks I am unaware off. Do your own research.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you plan on using an email client like Thunderbird, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to have access to SMTP ports which depending on the email provider might be a paid feature (eg. protonmail) or protected by account verification. This is done by providers to reduce spam and phishing emails being sent from their services.&lt;/li>
