### General

- https://www.thehacker.recipes/ (Better than hacktricks imo)
- https://viperone.gitbook.io/pentest-everything (great for AD stuff)
- hacktricks
- https://www.ired.team/ - always find gems in here. More oldschool but pretty awesome and well explained
- https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/ (found when looking for something specific, looks interesting)
- https://watchdogsacademy.gitbook.io/attacking-active-directory (found when looking at mssql stuff, also has cool shit I think)
- https://werebug.com/pentest-cheatsheet/ - cool layout for a cheatsheet, mostly basic content
- https://hideandsec.sh/books/cheatsheets-82c/page/active-directory-python-edition - pretty well maintained cheatsheet
- https://notes.qazeer.io/

 ### Mindmaps
