&lt;p>Windows VMs are great&amp;hellip; Until they hog half of your laptop&amp;rsquo;s resources, take up at least 40GB of storage and are basically unusable whenever an app requires the slightest amount of computing power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had that issue for a very long time until I came across this unbelievable tweet of Windows 11 running on 184MB of RAM:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>Any human successfully running Windows 11 on a 2009 iPod Touch amount of RAM is a legend in my books. I had to look into this in-human person who was going to be my spirit animal for the day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, this is not NTDEV&amp;rsquo;s first rodeo&amp;hellip; This man eats RAM for breakfast! Looking through his previous tweets and reading his blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised he has released a number of &lt;strong>tiny Windows ISOs&lt;/strong> for Windows 10 and Windows 11. These tiny ISOs are lightweight, stripped-down versions of their respective counterparts. I thought surely, they can&amp;rsquo;t be that much better than the official Windows 10 ISO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I tried them&amp;hellip; Furiously deleted on a few more resources and boy was I blown away by the final resource consumption reduction!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="../img/Windows%2010%20Task%20Manager%20Game%20Boy%20Color.png" alt="" loading="lazy" />&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Creating a Lightweight Windows 10 VM&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="creating-a-lightweight-windows-10-vm">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#creating-a-lightweight-windows-10-vm" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First, I download the tiny10 ISO from archive.org: &lt;a href="https://archive.org/download/tiny-10-23-h2/tiny10%20x64%2023h2.iso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://archive.org/download/tiny-10-23-h2/tiny10%20x64%2023h2.iso&lt;/a>. You can speed up this process using &lt;a href="https://aria2.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aria2c&lt;/a> to download the file with multiple server connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then installed it on my Virtualisation software of choice, namely &lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Emu_%28Dromaius_novaehollandiae%29_-head.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QEMU&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I booted it and decided to remove Microsoft Defender because I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it for the VM&amp;rsquo;s use case which reduced the RAM consumption a lot. I personally used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/TairikuOokami/Windows/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following tool&lt;/a> which worked at the time. As these are patched by Microsoft every so often, YMMV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also tried the &lt;a href="https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10/tree/master" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;Debloater&amp;rdquo;, not sure if it actually did anything&amp;hellip; Seems like most of it was already taken care of by NTDEV&amp;rsquo;s Tiny ISO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From looking at task manager and assessing the resource consumption of different processes, this felt like a good first pass where I eliminated the most consuming resources and attempting to go any further would take unreasonable amount of time for little benefit (Pareto principle).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that was pretty much it for optimisation&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Comparing an unmodified Windows VM with my custom Lightweight VM&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="comparing-an-unmodified-windows-vm-with-my-custom-lightweight-vm">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#comparing-an-unmodified-windows-vm-with-my-custom-lightweight-vm" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The following screenshots were made under the following conditions in an attempt to provide a fair comparaison:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>VMs were given the exact same resources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both were under zero load (ie. at rest, no user application running) when the screenshots were taken&lt;/li>
&lt;li>VM Screen Display settings were set to the same Display resolution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figure>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While comparing the two VMs, the following things were noted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The original Windows 10 VM was using around 1.5 times the Memory (RAM) of the Lightweight VM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CPU on the Windows 10 VM was a lot more sporadic, with numerous spikes even when no user application is running, while the Lightweight VM hovered around 1 to 2 % CPU utilisation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Windows 10 VM was around 27.3 GBs while the Lightweight VM required a maximum of 10.3 GBs to install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The initial ISO&amp;rsquo;s used had a 2.2GB size discrepancy, with the smallest being the tiny10 ISO: &lt;code>3.6G 'tiny10 x64 23h2.iso' 5.8G Win10_22H2_EnglishInternational_x64v1.iso&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Further improvements are potentially possible, however you should be cautious as &lt;strong>the more things you remove, the more likely you are to have issues, missing features and render the VM unusable&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="conclusion">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Overall, there is a significant amount of bloat on full Windows 10 ISOs which can be improved provided you don&amp;rsquo;t need the features that are being removed. This results in tiny ISOs with amazing benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lower RAM and CPU usage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smaller disk footprint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Faster boot and responsiveness&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These can be great for lower end devices, when you need to run a lot of VMs in parallel for examples for an Active Directory Lab Environment, to save battery/energy on a device, and more&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Further Research&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="further-research">&lt;/span>
&lt;a href="#further-research" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are definitely more things you can delete but you risk running into issues. &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/windows11/how-to-open-resource-monitor-using-task-manager-on-windows-11/3333480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resource Monitor&lt;/a> might be a great place to start:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in making your own tiny ISO&amp;rsquo;s, you should look at ntdev&amp;rsquo;s GitHub repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiny11builder&lt;/a> which has all the tools for building a tiny Windows 11 ISO. There are also a number of GitHub forks to create tiny Windows 10 ISOs too&amp;hellip; Do your own research.&lt;/p>
